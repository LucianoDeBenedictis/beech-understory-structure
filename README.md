R scripts for the article "Forest structure and understory functional diversity at multiple scales: the importance of median tree height", De Benedictis et al.

## Files description

Run the numbered scripts following the order to reproduce the analyses. Script 0 is automatically loaded when necessary.

0. functions: contains functions to calculate diversity indices and additional functions required by other scripts
1. nomenclature: creates lookup table of harmonized species names from transect data
2. data_setup: transect and traits data wrangling
3. resampling: performs computerized resampling of the transect
4. indices: calculates functional diversity indices from data
5. RCindices: calculates indices based on rotated components rather than traits
6. variables: structure and canopy data wrangling, variable selection and clustering
7. models: functional linear models and plots
8. soil_topo: extracts site variables for appendix B
9. function_test: checks raoq and qdecomp against known data
